> Modern SNES SPC700 toolchain

spcasm is a modern toolchain for the SPC700 processor architecture, famously used in the S-SMP as the sound co-processor of the SNES. spcasm is designed to be user-friendly, fast and feature-rich.

The spcasm project has expanded into emulation, and a cycle-accurate emulator called `sapemu` is being worked on.

spcasm consists of:

- The assembler `spcasm` itself
- The `brr` binary, a command-line BRR tool
- The assembly language server backend `sals` (LSP-compatible) and a Visual Studio Code frontend
- The [in-browser live assembler `spcasm-web`](https://spcasm.filmroellchen.eu)
- The (WIP) cycle-accurate emulator `sapemu`
- The (WIP) general-purpose .spc loading library `spcfile`

[This project is just for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/). Still, there's many reasons to use spcasm:

- **spcasm is fast. Best-in-class fast.** The assembler is between 1.3 (Windows) and 3.2 (Linux) times as fast as Asar. The BRR encoder runs at 1.6 MB/s on best compression, which is two times as fast as `BRRTools`.
- **spcasm runs in your browser.** (No, really, no server.) This is achieved with the power of WebAssembly, allowing spcasm to run so fast that a compile button would be overkill. See <https://spcasm.filmroellchen.eu> for a live demo based on the main branch.
- **BRR support:** spcasm has first-class support for BRR samples via the `brr` assembler directive. It also provides dedicated BRR tooling for use with other assemblers and more complex setups.

- Nice errors, helpful warnings and information about possible pitfalls. spcasm reports errors in a nice format, if your terminal supports it:

However, there are reasons why not to use spcasm:

- spcasm is not fully [Asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar)-compatible. Asar is the standard SNES-specific toolchain that is widely used (though ca65, WLA-DX and others are also an option). In particular, Asar provides many features for ROM hacking and patching. While spcasm has some Asar compatibility (in particular, whenever possible directives use compatible syntax), this is not spcasm's focus. There are many features in Asar that don't make sense for an SPC-700-only assembler, and there are other features that are intentionally not supported (such as namespaces). That being said, it is possible to write code with both Asar and spcasm compatibility, but the tradeoffs may not be worth it for all users.
- spcasm currently has no support for the common .spc file format, though that will change in the near future.
- `brr` is not quite as accurate as `BRRTools` in some scenarios. The latter seems to be the most accurate decoder when it comes to details.

## Installation

### Latest release

If you already have Rust, you can use `cargo install --locked spcasm`, which will install both the `spcasm` and `brr` binaries.

Alternatively, you can download the latest release asset for your system from the [GitHub release tab](https://github.com/kleinesfilmroellchen/spcasm/releases) and extract the binaries into a directory of your choice (on Unixes, usually either `$HOME/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`).

### From the repository

This is a normal Rust project without special dependencies. Use `cargo` or [`just`](https://just.systems/) for building, running, testing etc. The sub-projects of spcasm require extra dependencies and tools, for details see the [development documentation](https://kleinesfilmroellchen.github.io/spcasm/doc/dev/index.html).

## Usage

```trycmd
$ spcasm --help
A modern, user-friendly SPC700 assembler.

Usage: spcasm[EXE] [OPTIONS] <INPUT> [OUTPUT]

Arguments:
  <INPUT>
          Assembly file to assemble

  [OUTPUT]
          Binary output file

Options:
  -w, --ignore <IGNORE>
          Warnings to silence

  -W, --error <ERROR>
          Warnings to turn into a hard error

  -l, --reference-pass-limit <REFERENCE_PASS_LIMIT>
          Limit for the number of reference resolution passes spcasm will perform.
          
          Usually 2-3 passes are enough and very high pass numbers often indicate infinite loops. If
          this number of passes is exceeded during reference resolution, spcasm will report
          unresolved references as normal.
          
          [default: 10]

  -r, --macro-recursion-limit <MACRO_RECURSION_LIMIT>
          Limit for the number of recursive macro calls allowed by spcasm.
          
          Increase this limit carefully; very high recursion amounts are usually caused by
          infinitely recursive macros. Any recursion exceeding this value will cause a specific
          error.
          
          [default: 1000]

  -f, --output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
          Format to output to

          Possible values:
          - elf:      Output the binary data within a .data section of an ELF file
          - plain:    Output just the binary data
          - hex-dump: Dump hexadecimal representation in a pretty format like in a hex editor
          
          [default: elf]

  -d, --dump-references
          Dump all references and their final values / locations

  -a, --dump-ast
          Dump the program's abstract syntax tree. This is a debugging feature and most likely not
          useful to the end user.
          
          WARNING: This option will, in specific circumstances, loop forever trying to print
          recursive data structures. This can happen on well-formed programs.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version

```

spcasm follows the mnemonic conventions from [this APU manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20060208001231/http://www.alpha-ii.com/snesmusic/files/spc700_apu_manual.txt). The directive and macro syntax is a subset of the [VASM oldstyle syntax](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/release/vasm_6.html#Oldstyle-Syntax-Module) and also supports some [Asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar) features. If you're missing one of the features of vasm or Asar, it is probably appreciated in spcasm!

## [Documentation](doc/src/SUMMARY.md)

For all further information read the above.

[API documentation](https://kleinesfilmroellchen.github.io/spcasm/doc/api/spcasm/index.html) is also available online, in case you want to use spcasm as a library. Note that spcasm makes no stability guarantees in regards to its public APIs.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to spcasm! Help is always appreciated.

You can contribute by:

- implementing missing features from Asar or vasm
- reporting and/or fixing bugs
- writing documentation

See the [developer documentation](doc/src/dev/README.md) for developer information, including further information on how to build and configure spcasm.

## Acknowledgements

spcasm owes a lot to the SNES hacking and development scene (which I'm not even a part of!). In particular, I want to thank [IsoFrieze](https://isofrieze.com/) and his [SNES APU video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrn0QavLMyo&list=PLHQ0utQyFw5JD2wWda50J8XuzQ2cFr8RX) for nerdsniping me into this project. Also, the various reverse-engineered SPC700 documentation has been a huge help; I've not reversed anything myself.

Software-wise, the three main inspirations, especially in terms of feature set are [Asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar), [BRRTools](https://github.com/Optiroc/BRRtools) and [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/).
